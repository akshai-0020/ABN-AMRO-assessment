# Test assignment
We are looking for Automation Engineers that have the mindset "only the sky is the limit"
and "automation doesn't stop at testing, it's just a beginning!" ;)

The purpose of this test assignment is to assess the applicant's automation skills, allowing him/her to show the best they can do and how fast they can learn.
It is an open assignment. There is no the right answer and there is no end goal other than proving yourself. Surprise us!

Make sure that you give detailed comments or descriptions of your tests.
When the assignment is complete, please push your solution to Github(Gitlab) and send us the link.
If you have any questions, please contact us back.

Good luck!

PS. We don't expect you to spend weeks (and sleepless nights) on doing it. Lets see how far you can get in 6-10 hours. We want to see how you approach and solve problems.

And you will find the users to login in users.js.

How to run the scripts in your local machine?

-We are checking the functionality of this application using automation framework i.e., “Test Café”. The Scripts are implemented using JavaScript and Page Object Model(POM) approach.

3.Install git on your system to clone (To check use “git -v” in cmd prompt).

4.Once the git is installed open command prompt or git bash enter the code.

5.Install an IDE to view the code properly in your system (-Vs Code preferred).

To run the test scripts on your local machine from GitHub(Gitlab), please do the following steps:

1.Click on the clone link from the GitHub(Gitlab).

   git clone “clone link”.

2.Once it is cloned give “npm i” in the command prompt inside folder”testautomation-web" to install all dependencies needed.

3.Before running the script add the location path of the index.html in the Functional_tests/config_file/config.json under pageUrl.

4.Once all the dependencies are installed run the script using “npm run test”.

5.Scripts to run the code in different mode is present in package.json file. 

6.Test Scenarios prepared for automation are added in the Test plans.xlsx file inside the folder.
